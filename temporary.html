        <p class="about-me__biography__text"><span class="about-me__first-letter">My</span> coding journey started in
            summer 2015. For years I've had an active interest in the web and modern technology. Being fascinated with
            its continuous fast progress I set myself for a challenge to become a Web Developer.</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">I enjoy being a lifetime learner. I love creating something out of
            nothing by mixing up my knowledge, skills and imagination. The more days I see behind while learning to
            code, the more I fall in love with the new profession I chose to do for a living. In fact, I call it now my
            "full-time" addiction.</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">People who know me say I am a thorough person with an eye for details. I
            dislike sloppiness in real life and bring the same rules to coding.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text"><span class="about-me__first-letter">I</span> enjoy the process of
            building the web products from scratch. Solving problems and finding the best solutions is a creative
            process which often pushes us leaving our comfort zone and this is when we are growing, aren't we?</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">I chose Front End Development because it allows me to work closely with
            design. Having background in photography and digital illustrations I am pulled towards visual aspect of web
            development. It's amazing to be able to take a design and turn it into a functional product for people to
            use and enjoy.</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">All my projects are fully responsive. Turning my work into a good user
            experience on mobile devices is my priority and I take a great care of it.</p>

        <p class="about-me__biography__text"><span class="about-me__first-letter">I'm</span> a wife and a mum. When
            not coding I enjoy playing piano, walking the streets with my camera, having fun with my daughter, reading
            books and drink tea. Thrillers and books on self development are my number one choices.</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">Since 2010 I've been doing stock photography and have been selling images
            all over the world. Apart from taking photos I get a kick out of image post processing. I have a channel on
            YouTube dedicated to GIMP users who want to learn tips and tricks on editing photos and making
            illustrations.</p>
        <p class="about-me__biography__text">If you have any questions or would like to have a chat about coding, just
            drop me a line or two. I'm keen on meeting new like-minded people.</p>
